 🔒 What is CORS?
CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

It’s a security feature in web browsers that controls which websites are allowed to access resources (like APIs) from a different origin.

📌 What does “origin” mean?
An origin is defined as:


protocol + domain + port
Example:

https://example.com (origin 1)

http://localhost:3000 (origin 2)

These are different origins, even if they talk to the same API.
